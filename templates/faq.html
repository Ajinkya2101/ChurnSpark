            <div class="question">What is ChurnSpark?</div>
            <div class="answer">ChurnSpark is a tool that helps businesses understand which of their customers are most likely to stop using their services or products soon.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How does the ChurnSpark work?</div>
            <div class="answer">Our ChurnSpark uses data and past customer behavior to identify patterns and predict which customers might leave, helping you take action to keep them.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">What data is analyzed in the churn prediction process?</div>
            <div class="answer">The data analyzed includes customer demographics, contract details, payment methods, services used (e.g., online security, tech support), monthly charges, and tenure. These features help identify key patterns and trends contributing to customer churn.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">What key insights were found from the exploratory data analysis (EDA)?</div>
            <div class="answer">From the EDA, the following insights were uncovered:
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers using electronic check as their payment method tend to churn more often.</li>
                    <li>Monthly contract customers are more likely to churn compared to those on longer-term contracts.</li>
                    <li>Customers lacking online security and technical support are at a higher risk of churning.</li>
                    <li>Non-senior citizens show a higher likelihood of churning compared to senior citizens.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How do you handle missing or incorrect data?</div>
            <div class="answer">During the data cleaning process, rows with missing values, particularly in the "TotalCharges" column, were either removed or corrected by transforming the data. This ensures accuracy in the analysis and predictions.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Why is predicting churn important?</div>
            <div class="answer">Predicting churn is important because it allows businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers, improve satisfaction, and ultimately save on the costs associated with acquiring new customers.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">What tools and libraries are used in the ChurnSpark's EDA process?</div>
            <div class="answer">
